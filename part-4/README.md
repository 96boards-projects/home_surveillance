# 1) Hardware

## 1.1 Hardware requirements

- [Dragonboard 410c](http://www.96boards.org/product/dragonboard410c/)
- [96Boards Compliant Power Supply](http://www.96boards.org/product/power/)
- USB Webcam

## 1.2 Hardware setup

- DragonBoard 410 is powered off
- Connect USB webcam
- Connect I/O devices (Monitor, Keyboard, etc...)
- Power on your DragonBoard 410c with 96Boards compliant power supply

# 2) Software

## 2.1 Operating System

- [Linaro Debian based OS (latest)](https://github.com/96boards/documentation/blob/master/ConsumerEdition/DragonBoard-410c/Downloads/Debian.md)

## 2.2 Package Dependencies
 
Install the package dependencies mentioned in [Part-2](../part-2#22-package-dependencies) along with the following:

``` shell
$ sudo easy_install boto3
$ sudo apt-get install awscli
```
## 2.3 Setup AWS account

Follow the instructions mentioned [here](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/) for creating AWS account.

## 2.4 Create S3 bucket
 
- Go to https://aws.amazon.com/ and select Sign in to console 
- Login to AWS using your Email and password (You’ll be redirected to console if you are already logged in)
- Select S3 from Storage. S3 console will get opened.
- Click on Create bucket button
- Enter Bucket name and Region in the opened window (Bucket name should be unique across all existing bucket names in S3). 
- Click Next
- If you want to customize your bucket, modify the properties otherwise keep on hitting Next until you find Create bucket button.
- In the final window, you should see the Bucket name, region, properties and permissions. Under permissions the instance of the login account should get displayed. Then, click Create bucket.
- The created bucket would get listed in the AWS S3 console.
 
## 2.5 Set Object policy
 
- Select the created bucket and click Permissions tab on top
- Select Bucket policy and paste the following policy in the text field

```shell 	
{
  "Id": "Policy1495783674300",
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1495783672125",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::homesurveillance",
      "Principal": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```
- Replace ‘homesurveillance’ with your bucket name in the above policy and click Save.
- The above shown policy is just for demonstration purpose as it allows all AWS users to gain full access to the created bucket.
 
## 2.6 Setup Boto SDK
 
- Obtain the AWS key Id and secret key by following the instructions [here](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-access-key/)

- Execute the below command to configure boto SDK with created AWS Id and key
 ```shell
 $ sudo aws configure
 ```
 - Enter AWS access Id and press Enter
 - Enter Secret key and press Enter 
 - Enter region name and press Enter
 - You can leave the default output format as [None]. Just press Enter
 - Now Boto SDK has been configured. The entered credentials could be found in ~/.aws/config
 
# 3) Project Execution

Clone the project repository

``` shell
$ git clone https://github.com/96boards/projects.git
$ cd projects/home-surveillance/part-4
```
Place the trained dataset and haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml created in [Part-2](../part-2) to current directory. Also, update the USB webcam video source as specified in [Part-2](../part-2/README.md#31-creating-dataset)

``` shell
$ cp -r ../part-2/trainer ../part-2/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml ./
$ mkdir captured
$ sudo python streamface.py
```
Script will stream the first instance of detected faces onto AWS S3 bucket. Go to [AWS S3 bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) to see the list of streamed faces.
